I\\'m a controls engineer and pretty sure Amazon is simple recording everything in store then having a human review and tally purchases.

Only a single small sign that tells you the one tiny button to hit in the Amazon app to display a QR code to gain entry\\n\\n2. Store was about 50% empty. Most of the produce was gone and many empty shelves\\n\\n3. Only name brand junk food.\\n\\n4. Small selection of produce\\n\\n5. Alcohol section is lacking\\n\\n6. Prices are a little higher than other locations\\n\\n7. Amazon doesn\\'t give you a reciept or charge immediately. This further supports my idea that the store is simply reviewing purchases after the fact. Since there\\'s no reciept, and I didn\\'t record the prices for what I purchased there\\'s no way to know if the charge will be accurate. Amazon can increase prices and there\\'s no way to know unless you\\'re prepared.\\n\\nBasically this is a worse version of any convience store. Lack of selection, lack of prepared foods, no idea of the charges.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in a hurry, go to a 7/11, CVS, gas station etc. If you are hungry go to a real grocery store.\\n\\nIf you want to give Bezos more money to continue to exploit employees and waste it on sub orbital flights with a poorly designed rocket, then go to Amazon Fresh;The staff was very friendly and helpful.;No more check out lines!!!

(DR. was great) but after the exam, the service woman told me the price was $257 because it was comprehensive and a free pair of contacts. I said I wasn\\'t going to pay more than what I was told, and she suddenly lowered it to $197. I was then given the option to leave, without my prescription and had to take the \"free\" contacts out of my eyes. ISo I did.\\n\\nTerrible place. Move on to something else. Do not recommend.;I was SHOCKED when I came here to leave a review and saw all the negative reviews.  I had such a wonderful and great experience at this location.  I just became an active full-time employee at my current job and I was waiting for all my medical cards to physically arrive in the mail, but desperately needed needed an eye exam because I had run out of contacts and needed an updated prescription.  Elena, I believe is her name, was SO helpful.  She contacted me when she couldn\\'t find my vision insurance and followed up with me thoroughly up until my appointment just to let me know she was still looking into it and she was doing everything she could to make sure they located my insurance.  I took a wrong turn getting off the metro and was late to my appointment, but when I arrived, they were VERY kind and accommodated me.  Every single employee there greeted me, asked how I was doing, and made friendly conversation as I waited for different aspects of my appointment. The optometrist was great and knowledgeable. I received my lenses in the allotted time-frame they gave me and I also got complimentary sunglasses. I have NO CLUE why anyone would have a negative experience here.  It is some of the best customer service I have ever received in a medical office.;Had an eye exam and contact lenses fitted here and it was a great experience all around. I wish I could thank people by name, but everyone I encountered from the optometrist to the employee who trained me to put in contacts were very kind and patient. I\\'m glad this office is in my neighborhood.;The eye doctor here made me get a cheap brand of contacts that don\\'t support astigmatism and said it would be okay to wear once in a while. I thought I wouldn\\'t notice a difference but they\\'re just terrible. I intend to go back and run them for a proper set of contacts.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m trying to get a return but am told I can\\'t since I bought over 6 months ago. They also refuse to even sell me different contacts until I pay for another examination despite having a current and valid prescription. I understand the reasoning that eyes change, but it\\'s just unreasonable and devious to give someone contacts, admitting they may not work very well and then not allowing one to return. All I want is functional contact lenses. I\\'m $300 in the hole because I was misled. Malpractice sounds about right.\\n\\nEdit: I did in fact contact them about the issue like they commented below and they refused to do anything to help, so I\\'m confused why they would tell me to reach out.;I had a good experience. The appointment was easy to schedule and started on time. The staff was friendly and explained the charges before the exam started.

The line was quite long so I figured it was a pretty decent spot. The line went relatively quietly but I wasn‚Äôt impressed. The food was extremely salty and rather tasteless. I was sad to discover the cafe didn‚Äôt have WiFi so I had to pack up and head to a different coffee shop. The pricing was quite affordable, which lead to my two star rating but I won‚Äôt be returning.;I will never go back. So I heard about this place and figured that I would give it a try. First, if you don\\'t speak Spanish, good luck. I decided that I would get the sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin. They show it on the board and says the price is $4.05. I get no cheese as shown in the pictures and they charge me $4.55, I guess even though they show the item with a picture on an English muffin, they want to screw you for an extra 50 cents. The sausage is bland, the muffin soggy because it wasn\\'t toasted. First time here, last time here.;Worst customer service ever. They don‚Äôt like big orders. They told me to wait just before I put in\\nmy order. Then had the nerve to put all the breakfast items away in front of me and speak Spanish as if I couldn‚Äôt understand them.

I couldn\\'t just leave this baby there to become food for area stray cats looking for a quick snack so I ran into my house for a small box and some paper towels so that I could vet him safely into the box; once he was secure i googled \"wild bird\" rescue in NW, DC which is how I\\'d found these kind folks. When I arrived I was promptly greeted and given a short form to complete and I asked the lady if I could check on the baby bird later and i was given a caed with the birds code which I could reference when I called back. I called a few hours later and happily leared that his breed was identified as finch and that after resting and allowing his feathers to dry he was all set and flew out rescue centers doors to join a new family of finches.

Drinks aren\\'t watered down. And good service.;Please read your receipts carefully when visiting this place. They rang us up for Hennessy ($12) when we ordered Jack Daniel\\'s (8.39) and the bartender wanted us to believe that they cost the same and wouldn\\'t make changes to the charges on the check. There is also an automatic 18% gratuity added even for a party of 1. Management is unprofessional.

One of my regular spots for groceries.;Great things in the store fabolous;I like this place... They have many organic and grass fed brands that I can\\'t find at major chain stores. But. It\\'s really small, some of the items have obviously been sitting for some time, because they\\'re not as fresh as they could be. I\\'ll definitely go back again! Just... I\\'ve shopped at much better.;Small organic store that sell an amazingly large range of products (think Tardis - it\\'s bigger on the inside). Bulk spice, nuts, grains, oats etc, coffee beans, fresh veg, fruit, bread, and most any other food item you can think of. Manager and employees go out of their way to help.;I like that they sell organic stuff and make it accessible to people in this neighborhood. But the prices are expensive! Veggies were okay but didn\\'t look that fresh for the price.;The staff has been very helpful the past few times I\\'ve gone in. Their vegan options are growing which really makes me happy.

Although it clearly states they \"might\" .;They\\'re  awesome coz they make sure every restaurant or bar in the city is legit & has a license 2 sell alcohol. Also like the crackdowns on some restaurants & bars who dont have licenses making sure they get a license 2 sell alcohol legitimately instead of doing it illegally..wanna see more crackdowns @ restaurants & bars especially on Georgia Ave & 14th NW DC.;Rude. Get a new job if you don\\'t love what you do;Quick and friendly staff;It was an incredible experience to come to the House of Representatives and advocate for bills that will have an important impact on not only in my life, but all other constituents. It is a loud and fast pacing place, and a very pretty place too. It gives you a sense of responsibility and respect when walking among so many people with a huge pressure on their backs to fix the whole country\\'s problem. Be kind and understandable of how difficult and necessary it is for bills to become a law.

Super convenient and fast. First time using their notary and printing services. Best UPS experience in DC. I have lived here for 6 years! Ed is wonderful. Notary hours vary. Call ahead to confirm availability.;So I saw the recent negative reviews, and though I had a decent experience going here a few years back, I was curious to see if my 5-star ranking was no longer realistic.\\n\\nNope.  Sean was super helpful as I had three boxes and one loose item that all needed to go back to my company.  He took them all no problem and I was in and out of there fast with a reasonable price.  Much easier than the Post Office, even if it does cost more.;Solid UPS. You may pay more, but their hours are good, service is solid and it\\'s easy in/out location.;I have used this store for notary services, printing, and overnight mailing. Miles is always helpful, courteous and professional.;Miles is super duper helpful and efficient. Can\\'t ask for more than that.;The gentleman behind the counter was nice and helpful.;Great service, friendly stuff!;After many years of so so dentist l finally found a dentist that understands what the patients feel every time they sit in the chair. He, office admin staff and his techs help lower your level of apprehension from the moment you arrive. Treatment is quick and concise with any and all questions fully answered. No dental work is completely pain free, but Dr. Kirunda comes as close to it as possible.;I love this dentist. He fixed shoddy work performed by my last dentist and had kept my mouth in great shape. 10/10 would recommend.;I honestly cannot say enough good things about Dr. Kirunda & his staff. What a great experience...at THE DENTIST! How often do you get to say that?! Making the appointment was quick and the woman who answered the phone was so sweet and helpful. Everyone greeted me politely when I walked in today. The practice is clean, the waiting area is comfortable with HGTV on (yay!) and complimentary tea/water/coffee. Dr. K cleans your teeth HIMSELF. What other dentist is that hands-on? He explained exactly what he was doing, told me when something might feel a little sensitive, and thoroughly went over my x-rays and his suggestion for my next services. I am SO happy I found such a great dentist in DC. Very grateful for the excellent service today! I know I\\'m in good hands.;I was pleased with the service I got today!;My 6 months appointment Monday was quick and Dr. Kirunda didn\\'t have to do much other than a 6 months cleaning and I got a good report.  Thanks.;Parking can be tough, so come early. They take amerihealth;The absolute best!;The staff here were helpful, friendly, and quick. The pickup and drop off processes were efficient and their indoor store allows you to buy the last minute things needed for a move. I\\'d of course recommend using a smaller, or local company to move, but if you can\\'t this U-Haul is a good option. You can park your car there for free in their parking lot during the day while you move and the whole thing was pretty hassle-free.;They really work to find the best storage for your needs and customer service is good!!;Great place for a truck rental and/or moving supplies. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I prefer them over any other locations in the area.;Watch out and be sure to take your own verification pictures. We returned our vehicle with the same gas it had at the time of rental and were charged for a full tank. The staff is unhelpful and incredibly rude. Document everything so you have proof when returning your vehicle and they try to charge you extra.;I cannot recommend this place to a friend due to the face the guy who attended the returns area Charles is rude, unprofessional and is smoking in people faces offensively.  Has a hideous attitude towards good working people. Everyone else was AWESOME;The place was a bit hard to find, but the people were very nice and helpful.;Great customer service, truck was clean and on time. My 3rd time and they really have it down;Good place to get a rental. Well stocked and we\\'ll located. Their vans are brand new and really good!;Quick and easy with above and beyond service! I was able to rent the truck in 10 minutes the night before so that when I drove up I contactless picked up the truck and went! Drop off was done in a safe and distanced manner. All trucks are thoroughly disinfected before next rental. All this at an unbelievable low price.;Make sure you take lots of pictures when you drop it off and when you return it. We were charged $150 for a \"broken light\" that we definitely did not do. On the receipt it says the incident happened at 6:30 pm, but we returned the van at noon. The person we called told us that 6:30 was just the time that they got a chance to inspect the vehicle and see that the light was damaged. We took pictures when we picked it up, but it looked exactly the same when we dropped it off so we didn\\'t bother. That\\'s on us for trusting this place, but they didn\\'t have to do that to us.;Customer service needs to be more friendly;Customer service was good. Clerks are knowledgeable and easy to talk to.;Great for in-town moves in the DMV... especially when you\\'re picking up furniture for your girlfriend Casack;New ways of conctless return of rental truck..nice uhaul app;Staff that was present when I dropped off my u-haul was unprofessional, argumentative, and rude. Also  e warned of the deceptive fee structure. Our 19.99 a day van for two days with minimal milage ended up at $160.\\n\\nIf you have any other options for somewhere else.;Note to any renters ask to see or check truck before signing.....I signed out a truck saying the tank was full and miles she also different.;I\\'ve used this location a few times with good results. If you get there right as they open, you should be able to pick up your truck/van quickly. If you wait until later in the day - plan some time.  The staff was fine, not overly friendly, but not rude either.;They\\'re poor because if you miss a payment they will not let you get into your unit.;Super organized, friendly staff, clean vehicles.;Nice and helpful staff;Great service and very convenient!;Customer service was Pleasant enough but I did have a hard time finding the truck pick up area... the other staff seem like they didn\\'t really care that much they were okay not to helpful. Truck was in good condition. Service was quick for me.;This U-haul runs like a machine. It was super easy to reserve, pick-up and drop off the U-haul and they answered all my questions before I even had the chance to ask them. The facility is also easy to get to and leave from, so driving a big moving truck for the firs time was less intimidating;Staff is always helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I\\'ve had a storage unit there for several years, and have never had any problems. Only problem area: parking is horrible. Not enough of it, especially if you are loading/unloading.;Very busy place;Third rental in a month and this place is on their game! Fast in and out. Clean truck. Very professional. Best U-haul in US. Check in online.;Double stacked lockers/units, with small doors for medium and small lockers, makes it hard to put a couch into them.  I would look at other spots.  Although good place to pick up packing material - even has a tv cases;Great clean place.;Im giving 5 stars bc it still has my stuff in it. But it does not have a temp controlled environment.;Made payment on storage;Excellent service and convenient location.  I checked in online so the entire process to get the truck and be on my way took less than 15 minutes.\\n\\nThe location is less than 10 minutes walking from the RI metro stop.\\n\\nAnd the truck was brand new with 1k miles on it!;U-Haul storage is always good in case of need, but this location has trouble beyond the patience of regular humans. Their system is frozen most of the time, which is discouraging when you have Sat 30th and Sun 31st to move, wasting 3h of your time waiting just to get the storage unit contract, without the possibility of overtime access to the storage unit because it is not available for the storage building. U-Haul is a good addition to my life, but this location isn\\'t;Horrible experience thru the mobile app for an after-hours pickup and dropoff, on what is supposed to be a seamless process. The app is extremely clunky and regularly doesn\\'t register your clicks to allow you onto the next page.\\n\\nYou need to submit all kinds of info upon arrival, not before, so prepare for a lengthy delay at pickup time despite the fact that they could\\'ve just had you submit everything earlier. Someone on their end needs to verify it in real-time, including calling a friend or family member just to verify that you indeed exist and are renting a truck. Unsure how this is a real security measure but regardless.\\n\\nThen they gave me the lockbox code to get the truck keys, but the app was so clunky that that page disappeared before I could read it. So I promptly spent the next 20 minutes in the pouring rain on hold with their customer service line, just to get the damn lockbox code. The app thought I\\'d already started driving, so my only option there was to request roadside assistance (dysfunctional app wouldn\\'t let me submit a request for that either).\\n\\nAdd it all up and you\\'ve got a terrible user experience. Find any other truck or equipment rental service whenever possible.;Excellent storage facility in all the time my property has been stored there. Try them for yourself!;Terrible management and the Gen. Mgr named Ousman is THE WORST!!!!! This location would rather take your money before providing a \"complete\" service to you!;This is a great US haul outlet. Shops in Md do not always have more than 1 of each size cargo trailers in stock.;Very happy with my moving experience. Not a lot of hidden fees, good service, and decent location (walking distance from the Rhode Island Avenue metro station) makes this U-Haul a good choice for in-town moving;I love this place,  I love working here and helping people...üòçüòçüòç;Good service but very slow, it took me almost one hour to get my truck which was already reserved online;Conveniently located but parking is an issue in the area.;Poor service. Called about donating furniture, and they failed to inform me that donations can be left in the storage facility!;Great customer service;Good deal...;They put a hold on your funds without telling you. And the when you ask to speak to a manager he is rude and nasty telling you that you have to call your financial institution;Great service.;There were dead rats,magets,and rat poop all over my belongings;Very friendly and proficient staff.;Everyone is so nice;Stop by to get treated like you\\'re an idiot by rude staff!;great service;Good location great place;Very tiny storage area and no parking.;Excellent service;Knowledgeable and helpful.;very convenient service;Service isn\\'t that good;Everything was as described, friendly staff;Great storage;Very friendly staff, hooked everything up for me;Slowest customer service ever;Busy at weekend;Cheese pizza for my teen majority of the time and this location makes their pizzas better than many other Little Caesars locations near by ...but our last pizza was burnt ( hot and ready ) I didn\\'t return it but I don\\'t expect it again.. I had dozen of great ones!! And the guy that normally works the register evenings/ nights  WASN\\'T THERE but he has great customer service, I don\\'t think he would have given that pizza out ..will return;Very fast and consistent.  Pizza here is always decent enough for something quick - and a whole large pizza is just $5.99!  It\\'s not great - or fancy - or dine-in - but then again, it\\'s not supposed to be.;The food is good. Never had any issues but I have to wait for my pizza to be cooked when the slogan says \"Hot n Ready\". Other than that we cool;Place was clean, folks were nice, pizza was Great !! And, the price was good.;I enjoy the food it\\'s great. I can\\'t get enough. I am always back for more.;OMG...The worst customer service experience ever! Being from the Midwest, I was SO excited to learn that a new Little Caesars was coming to NW DC. Maybe 3 weeks after its grand opening, I paid a visit to this location and I vowed to never return. When 1st entering the store, I was not welcomed by any type of greeting. The girl at the register pretty much stared at me while I was deciding on what to order as if I was holding her up.\\n\\nWhen inquiring about the Hot and Ready pizzas, I asked how long the pizzas had been sitting out and she said they had just come out the oven. I also asked about the crazy bread and she said the same thing. So I placed my order, received my food and it was very luke warm. I politely asked her if they could make a fresh pizza and set of breadsticks for me and she said , \"These ARE fresh\" with the biggest attitude. So we went back and forth a little bit and eventually she asked the cook to make a fresh order, accompanied by an eye roll. When I got my food, it was the sloppiest thing I had ever seen in life.\\n\\nI then asked her for a refund and she said a manager needed to be there in order for this to happen. I asked her to call the manager if he/she was not there and she claimed they weren\\'t answering the phone. Long story short, I tried calling the store the next day, no response. Then I called district and got a callback right away with refund info and a free pizza offer. I declined the free pizza offer and assured them that I would never return to this particular location again.;Good place take and out quickly although the  cashier wasn\\'t friendly but other than that a good place;Great Pizza ever it\\'s good not too oily...;The pizza was not hot and it was naste will never eat from them again;I usually like ordering from here, but my order just arrived with one incorrect item and another missing item.

Delivery itself is fairly quick for DC as well. I\\'ve had many of the standards and they\\'ve all been good, my last order however I decided to try Chow Mein for the very first time it was AWESOME, j don\\'t know if this is indictive of the fish though since I\\'ve never bothered to order it anywhere else. I usually stick to the Szechuan dishes, but I\\'ve had many of the other offerings and liked them as well. The Wonton soup is good, not the best and I\\'ve had the egg drop soup, but again it was my first order of it and it was nice, not my cup of tea. This is how I feel about the dishes at any asian place I\\'ve been to and tried like hot garlic sauce dishes, I\\'ve had it at many places in DC and I just don\\'t like it, but Szechuan house at least has the garlic I can see and the vegetables and meat are fresh. Living in SW there aren\\'t as many options but Szechuan house should be at the top of your choices.;This is my favorite takeout Chinese food in DC. It\\'s just the perfect comfort food that you want on a rainy night to eat too much with friends (or by yourself) and watch movies. Everything I\\'ve tried has been delicious and satisfying. I also ate in once, and the service was great! Definitely recommend this place.;This is the best Chinese takeout in the Waterfront/Navy Yard/Eastern Market area.  The food is great quality, the employees are nice and helpful, and the delivery is prompt. I‚Äôm impressed that they always read my extra instructions in the online order and follow through. This is the only Chinese takeout I will order in the area. :);Excellent take-out, friendly staff. Really, really, good General Tao\\'s Tofu. Easy to miss if you aren\\'t looking for it.;Great little, local takeout and delivery! Occasionally been going here throughout the past year. It\\'s not amazing, it\\'s nothing special, and it\\'s unremarkable for any special event, but it gets the job done!\\nVery nice staff, and an order has never been wrong, and it\\'s extremely quick.

Doctors and offerings were okay, kinda generic American Chinese food, but the portions were super small considering the price.;Great Chinese food.;Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe it was the hair in my food... But I won\\'t be eating here again.;Fun store of great gifts with a helpful staff. They held our purchases at the front desk so we didn\\'t have to hold them while we decided what we wanted.

Overall a good way to spend time cutting through the red tape!;Ashley  in cubicle C was really helpful, listened and she is calm and a soothing voice. Thank you Ash. I came immediately when they opend at 9am. So the line was not that bad.;Extremely slow service. It‚Äôs not true about Monday mornings being the fastest service day. I‚Äôve been there today because I read the other reviews. Every damn day are the same with the line that take ages and then waiting again for your number being called is taking eons. Expect your time here to be 2-3 hours at average. The place also stinks and filled with flies because of the kind of people that come here for service. I don‚Äôt want to come back here again.;They are very inexperienced!

From the optician to sales there is nice service.\\n\\nBut the buy 2 pair of glasses for half off the price and / or the \"Buy one pair get one free\" deals appear to be nothing but a sales scheme, no real deal is possible. There is no reason I see to be disqualified from the sales specials if I\\'ve paid $300-$500 out of pocket.  It shouldn\\'t matter how much my insurance covers. \"Restrictions apply\" of course.   Most know buying glasses completely out of pocket with a prescription is very expensive at most stores. So where\\'s the deal?\\n\\nSo my recent purchase from Visionworks is probably my last. Buyer be aware don\\'t go in expecting the \"buy one get one free\" special to be a real thing;We had a great experience.staff was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.

I had an error with my glasses and they apologized and gave me new ones at no cost! I recommend this place for sure!;I am deeply saddened to write such a review. Last year when my daughter & I visited this location it was great! Today that all changed when we showed up for our appointments and were told it was MANDATORY for us to take some specialized test that was on sale for $19.99 to even receive an eye exam. This is after waiting 25 minutes for our appointments! i have health insurance but, was denied service if i didn\\'t agree to pay $40! That\\'s like my doctor refusing to examine me if I don\\'t pay a thermo-body scan! The rationale provided to me was that due to an extended length of time between visits due to COVID, the company made it a requirement! That\\'s ludicrous! We only visit once a year anyway so that doesn\\'t make sense! i don\\'t even wear glasses. Why would I pay for a fancy test! Sounds to me like a business just trying to recoup funds during a pandemic. Sooo disappointed! This place is near my home & now I have to find somewhere else. I will also report them because I don\\'t believe it\\'s legal to deny someone with insurance service because they won\\'t pay for an additional & completely unnecessary test!;Excellent customer service!

We were greeted as we walked in the door. When I had a question the newest employee Sabrina came from behind the counter and walked over and explained the difference in prices for the supply pack and the individual boxes. Once we made or selection she rang us up and was most courteous . She said she had only been there for 3 weeks and did not hesitate to ask for assistance from her colleagues when she was unsure.

Definitely worth stopping in if you‚Äôre looking for something or need a gift.;Awesome, awesome, awesome experience from start to finish. Leah is so knowledgeable about every single item in her store and was exceptionally patient while I figured out what type of knives I was looking for. Her expertise and clear explanations helped me really narrow down my options. I look forward to purchasing more cookware in the future because I know ‚Äîwithout a doubt‚Äî that I can ask Leah and get straight answers. She had all of them!\\n\\nAdditionally, she took numerous COVID precautions, including requiring masks covering the nose and mouth of all customers, limiting the number of customers to four (not four ‚Äúgroups‚Äù ie households, but four people‚Äî full stop.), maintaining an appropriate distance, and ensuring each customer used hand sanitizer upon entering.

I recommend shopping here and supporting this local business.;A lovely small business with a host of wonderful products- cookbooks, pots and pans, etc.  The staff‚Äôs knowledge is amazing.  I bought an obscure cookbook and they were able to point out exact recipes I‚Äôd like.  The staff also goes to great lengths to ensure customers purchase the proper products.  They quizzed me on my intended usage for a frying pan before offering a recommendation.;What a lovely local business! Staff is nice and welcoming, and there are a decent amount of kitchen selections. I definitely try to come here for my kitchen outfitting news.;Such a cute store! I know if I ever need a gift for my chef friends or just want something to sprouts up my kitchen I can go to Hills Kitchen!

I\\'ve been going here for 6 years now, and will keep going here as long as I\\'m living in DC.;It\\'s a small store, but they manage to fit a large selection into it. They have at least two options for most major kitchen appliances, a good knife selection and a wall of pots and pans.

I love to support local business, and this place has become my spot for kitchen needs;I am so glad this store exists in Eastern Market. It adds a neighborhood feel to the area.

It\\'s the bottom floor of a beautiful row house and has any kitchen need you can imagine from state shaped cutting boards to fancy wine glasses.;Lovely little shop that has some unique items that make it more than a kitchen goods store. One more than one occasion, I\\'ve gone in for the states-shaped cookie cutters to send to friends, and have sent others there who are looking for gifts for their favorite bakers.

Two days in a row came in to buy pain killers and couldn‚Äôt get anyone to open the cages they‚Äôre locked inside. It doesn‚Äôt even matter that the employees are friendly, this store must be way understaffed when you can‚Äôt even get medicine in a drugstore!;CVS is like purgatory. Nothing against this particular CVS but every CVS I go into is Bland\\'s the service is terrible and I assume it\\'s because they\\'re not paying any of their employees enough to give them incentive for it. everything is overpriced and even on the app I\\'m never sure if I\\'m going to leave feeling like I got what I needed out of it.;I\\'ve shopped here from time to time - staff was very nice. Products were available and not reasonably priced (although not as low as some other convenience store locations);I feel as though it\\'s your regular CVS. Very convenient location, right by the Georgia Ave/Petworth Location. May not be the best as far as having everything, but I have gone there for basic needs and not had an issue. Not much store assistance. Walked around multiple times looking for a cream, maybe passed and employee twice and wasn\\'t offered any assistance...but overall nothing but regular CVS experiences.;Friendliest CVS Staff I‚Äôve ever encountered, but there‚Äôs always one cashier. The wait in line can be very long, especially without self checkout.;Pharmacist Mehret is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.;The staff here is friendly, but this store is very drab. It feels like a prison inside and the ‚Äòdecor‚Äô leaves quite a bit to be desired. It could definitely use a facelift like some of the CVS and Walgreens locations downtown.;I  been a customer for years and I especially like,\\nThe greetings I get from pharmacy staff.\\nAlways service with a smile I been in pain when I arrived, but when I leave I don\\'t think about the pain  because where just like family.\\nOverall great store!.;Extremely poor service.  Pharmacy service has gone downhill over the last 6 months.  Pharmacy does not pickup calls. I had to literally call the store mamager to inquire abt prescriptions on several occasions.

I don\\'t actively avoid this CVS like I do the one in Columbia Heights.;While this is a fairly new CVS, the service is only average.;The pharmacy here is the worst, though most CVS pharmacies suck. They are ALWAYS understaffed and there\\'s always some problem. Never fill your prescription here.;Just a basic CVS.;Food quality is pretty good. You pick up meal plans, purchase frozen meals, buy smoothies or actual prepared food all at a convenient price. It can be an overwhelming experience because there is not a lot of guidance going in. If you can self navigate or aren\\'t afraid to ask questions you can make this place work for your needs.;I was walking down H street looking for a place to eat a couple hours before the gym, and stumbled on this Mecca for anyone intentionally eating and drinking to lose, maintain OR build their body. They offer wide range of fresh and frozen meals, as well as many types of healthy drinks. I got 2 frozen meals (which they  were happy to heat up for me to eat there), Cajun ground beef and Asian shredded beef for $7.50 each. That\\'s a great deal compared to other food prep services, on top of which they offer 1 free when you buy 5 at a time. LOVE the \"what\\'s your vision\" sheets. This place makes it easy to meet my goals without endless shopping and weighing of ingredients;If you are health conscious and are interested in having a convenient option in the city then I highly recommend Clean Eatz. I went during the dinner hour (6:00PM)and quickly parked and had my dinner and also a meal to go in about 20 minutes, my food was hot and tasty..I purchased the Watch your Waist with Salmon and I got a togo meal to prepare later.

Can\\'t believe they had the nerve to deliver these to me.;Came in on #MLKDAY! and was not disappointed. Staff is patient and on point, and the food is delicious and not to be missed.

Great place for a corporate event during the summer.;Beautiful views and location. The food was really good too. It\\'s a rooftop and is an amazing venue with great service and food.;I was here for a conference dinner on the rooftop. The food was lackluster and ran out multiple times. the event was by reservation only so it was not as if Capitol View had no idea on how many patrons to expect. The two bars that were on the rooftop were cash only and hard to navigate towards. The bathrooms were also located a fair distance away. After a bit of socializing (like an hour), many of my peers decided to go to another venue.;Beautiful rooftop location provides lovely views of the Capitol in all its glory.;Spectacular views. Great venue;Beautiful place.;nice  for venues;Layla Lounge is the place to be. Open space, cool atmosphere, what\\'s not to love. I was here on Monday for Munchies Monday.

But the venue was kind of dark, nothing looked new or modern, upstairs and downstairs are not that big, weird location.;This place was horrible.

We always get the stuffed crust cheese pizza and wings. There seems to be an error with the app. Our order was placed at 602pm and still not ready an hour later at 702pm when the \\'track my order\\' feature stated my food had been \\'picked up\\'. The employees seemed to be stressed on this particular Friday night and the female in the front making pizzas with her pants half way down seemed to not be in the best spirits but still trying to get everyone\\'s orders out the door.\\nOur order was not complete with the sides so you may have to remind them but you will get great tasting food.;I usually order from the 11th street store and am happy with their pizza tonight however I tried to order their $10 special of two large two topping pizza for takeout online.Their site would only let me order one pizza and wouldn\\'t let order the second.After multiple attempts online I called the store to order the \"special\" .The woman t as king my order said ok and repeated the order back to me, and told me it would be 20 minutes until the oder was ready. I get to the store and she rings my oder up and tells me it\\'s now $27 and change. I\\'m like \"that\\'s not what t was listed online and what\\'s the problem\"? She tells me there\\'s tax and I\\'m saying \"Not $12 or more in tax\"! Then she says ,\"well that\\'s the online special and you called the order in\". I\\'m now explaining I\\'ve called in orders before and that\\'s never been a problem, then she goes on to say \"well our policy has changed\" ! So a few more seconds of conversation goes nowhere and now I\\'m angry AND hungry so I  pay for the pizzas and leave.  Papa John\\'s has just lost another customer an now get home to find out there\\'s little bacon on my chicken  and bacon pizza. All in all a frustrating and disappointing experience!;Ordered a pizza at 6:30. Was told it would take an hour. Driver showed up at 7:47. By the time I read the box and saw that it was someone else\\'s pizza, she had driven off. I called the store and they said they would send her back.

Speaking from experience, I suggest you approach this otherwise excellent veterinary clinic with caution  -- never hurts to question your doctor so why not your dog or cat\\'s.;Dr Murdoch is very capable, compassionate, and communicates clearly recommendations and options. My Buddy cat is recovering very quickly from an urgent procedure. Everyone else I encountered was professional and helpful.;In the first few years that this clinic opened, I had to put down my cat. I went there because it was close and I could see how they handled me and my pet.  They gave him the ultimate dose before telling me that this would be it!  So I had no chance to say good-bye to him or pet him!  I was really upset.\\n\\nToday, 2016, I needed their cooperation to work with another vet\\'s office to get some pain medication today for my new cat who has cancer.  I called three times in the a.m. and never got a response.  It just went to voice mail and no one ever bothered to call me back.\\n\\nI\\'d like to say something good about this clinic, but with these experiences, I simply cannot.   They do not exhibit the sensitivity and care that I would and should expect from any veterinary clinic.;This place misrepresented itself, and made untruthful statements both verbally and in writing.\\n\\nThe practice manager, Richard Cohen, admitted that his wife and friends work at Friendship Hospital for Animals, which negligently/maliciously gave my cat dog medication and caused him to suffer. My cat had to be put to sleep as a result of the negligence of Friendship Hospital for Animals.\\n\\nFriendship Hospital for Animals was under investigation for animal abuse/cruelty and Dupont Veterinary Clinic provided Friendship Hospital my cat\\'s clinical records without my authorization, despite the fact that they initially claimed that it was good that Friendship is being investigated for animal cruelty and promised not to provide my cat\\'s clinical records. Dupont\\'s agents were aware that I attended Friendship Hospital with the police in order to retrieve my cat and they were instructed not to provide any information to Friendship. Dupont claimed that they have no relationship with Friendship, yet the practice manager later admits to his ties to Friendship.\\n\\nThe unlawful conduct of Dupont should be addressed.;Great place although a bit expensive. However they outlined the cost every step of the way and Dr. Dan was fantastic!;Outside of the parking aspect, a great place to take your pets if you want quality care!;Alley has some very useful spaces which I\\'ve been to several times.

I appreciate the customer service here, especially Tyler.  On a previous rental, when I got lost, he help me navigate to their location.  I was dealing with a serious medical emergency  regarding a parent about a hour away and needed to get back my rental.  Tyler was kind to say that I can stay at the hospital and get the car back as soon as the emergency was settled. If you have ever had a number of things go wrong at once and someone makes one of those things better, it means the world.\\nI read some of the other reviews here, for example, when people have to wait for the reps at the desk, yes that can be frustrating. But the reps take you down the elevator to the garage and help you find your rental.  Its is a large hotel location, it can take time.  My rental has smelled a little of smoke in the past, I just rolled the window down for 10 minutes and it was fine.  I do not smoke but we live in DC and I am not sure how the reps would prevent people from smoking in the cars while using them.\\nI have paid extra in rental just to rent at this location because the reps are very nice, the cars are consistently in great shape and the location is near Dupont metro (for heading to and from the rental), I recommend this Hertz.;You have to walk back through the Hilton lobby to find the small desk.

Very professional;Love this shop go every Thursday go place to talk sports and you will get a great cut;Great service and attention to detail!;I went over there Tuesday;They are very fast;Staff and customers all very chill and friendly, classic neighborhood barbershop.;Black Excellence...;I\\'ve been to the Banfield in SW and was always treated as a valued customer, and my cats were always well-cared for. The same cannot be said of this location.\\n\\nAt this point we\\'ve visited twice. The first time we came, we were not informed of their \"dropoff only\" policy, and it was raining. We and our cats were left outside in the rain for 10 minutes before they came and brought them in. They tried to make up for that with a complimentary nail trim, which was nice so we thought we\\'d give them another chance.\\n\\nThe second time, we dropped them off for a teeth cleaning today. We were told they could not eat 12 hours before; that\\'d we\\'d receive a call from the vet in the afternoon informing us of their progress; and that we could expect to pick them up around 3-4pm.\\n\\n5 o\\'clock rolled around, and we\\'d heard nothing all day. We called the office and were told the cats were still under treatment and that we could expect to hear from them before the office closed at 6.\\n\\n6 o\\'clock rolled around and we heard nothing. We called back and were told that one of the cats was still under care. At this point, knowing my cats likely hadn\\'t been fed all day, I asked what exactly the vet had been doing with my cats given we had dropped them off almost 12 hours prior to this call. The representative said that Dr. Joseph Ianniello - the vet overseeing the procedures - had likely shifted our cats\\' appointments around depending on the different walk-ins and drop-offs of the day. At no point were we ever updated on this, and at no point did the doctor seem to care that two hungry cats might deserve to be treated at their allotted times so they wouldn\\'t have to go 24 hours without food unnecessarily.\\n\\nWhen it\\'s all boiled down, the simple fact was that expectations were set and not met: we were told our cats had a morning appointment (their procedure didn\\'t start until at least 5pm); we were told we\\'d get a call from the vet (he skipped out and never called us before ending his shift. Thanks Dr. Ianniello!!); we were told we\\'d pick our cats up between 3-4pm (we just got home at 7pm).\\n\\nIf you can\\'t meet expectations that YOU set, don\\'t set them. Period. We will be calling tomorrow (since none of the doctors were available to speak with us) to cancel our wellness plan with them. \"Wellness\" implies they care for your pets, when it\\'s clear from this recent experience that your pet is nothing but a number and a fat wad of cash to them.;They took really good care of my lil Fella;The personnel is awesome.  Mr. Cook gave exceptional customer service.;Love that they really keep you informed. The vet spoke w/me after seeing my dogs and was more thorough than any vet I\\'d seen before in the DMV (City Paws & Takoma vet clinic, to be exact.)\\nDr. McFarland and Ulysses, plus a young woman whose name I regretfully did not catch helped me and my dog that day. They were wonderful.;My best pal, Mick Jagger goes there. I couldn\\'t be happier. The level of care and the in depth exams are a plus. Their health plans are awesome. Their professionalism goes above and beyond.  I couldn\\'t recommend them more. They are just awesome;Very happy with how they took care of my cat;I brought my dog in for an examine; glad I did! My dog\\'s behavior said it all! I\\'m loyal forever!;Took my new puppy here and had a great experience! Other vets in the area seemed like they were always trying to upsell but Banfield put him on a comprehensive insurance plan that covers unlimited office visits so I don‚Äôt worry about being ‚Äúsold‚Äù services I don‚Äôt need. I will be bringing my cat here from now on too!;Amazing staff. And love for my pup!;Although my 1y/o Daisy the pug is a patient at the Navy Yard location, Adams Morgan staff welcomed her there for a nail clipping.

Highly recommended.;This was my first time getting a Brazilian wax and the technicians made me feel extremely comfortable. They worked quickly and gave me clear instructions for after care. I will definitely return.;A++++ service here. I have become a regular client;I\\'m torn. I have had my eyelashes and eyebrows tinted, and well as brows threaded, at silky smooth several times. The first few times, I was pleased and actually felt the services were better than high end salons that provide the same services. However, the past few times the services have been inconsistent and highly dependent on the individual providing the services. Unevenly colored brows. Bluntly ended brows. Lashes that are not anywhere black. I definitely don\\'t go out of my way to come here anymore and often find myself nearby, needing tinting, and still not stopping in.;My favorite place to get my brows done. They always have a spot without any reservations, they are fast and good price. I always leave happy with my perfect brows. I don\\'t have any preference, always go with whoever is available and never left disappointed. Highly recommend!;I have been a customer for over a year, having eyebrow tinting and brow threading.  I recently added facial waxing.  I had a tinting of the brow the 24th of December and noticed that the dye was FADING rather quickly, within 4 days the gray hair was back and on the 9ith day following the service I went back to the salon for them to correct.  I expected the correction to  be quick but I found A CALL TO THE OWNER was needed and I was told that if I wanted a correction it SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWO DAYS from the time of a tinting.  TINTING LAST BETWEEN 4to6 WEEKS!!!  I was tinted quickly without  paying for the service again.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BEHAVIOR and WILL RE-THINK using this salon again.  THIS IS NOT HOW TO TREAT A LOYAL CUSTOMER!;Wonderful staff and great COVID precautions taken!;The owner of the place texted me, harassing me.\\n\\nI went to Silky Smooth DC. It was the first day of  woman who was threading me and she was just trying to make conversation. She asked me about me and so I reciprocated. I found out that she\\'s been in the States for 4 years and has an 8 year old daughter. The remainder of her family husband and mother are back in Nepal and she\\'s collecting money to sponsor them to come here. She makes very little money lives off of tips cannot afford to really live in a place by herself so rents a room in somebody else\\'s house for herself and daughter.;They took me as a walk in and I was out after a threading in less than 15 mins! The staff is extremely professional and the business is very clean and nice. They even have all sorts of charges located in the waiting area which was a nice surprise.;I was pleased with the service I received. It‚Äôs a nice clean shop with wonderful customer service. I will be returning to get my eyebrows threaded again!!!;I have been there twice for my eyebrows and was totally satisfied. I would recommend Silky Smooth to anyone looking for pampering herself.

I very much have enjoyed my time at CTC so far - I\\'ve had the opportunity to meet a diverse, accomplished group of members and received a warm welcome from the membership.  The club offers varied activities, ranging from interesting book talks and lectures to more social events like wine tastings and seasonal parties.  The food and wine selection is fabulous.  The building itself, c. 1796, is extremely well maintained and well-appointed with beautiful furniture and decoration on its seemingly endless floors.  The club is a lovely place to host your next get together or party and can handle events of all sizes and types.  Heather and staff are the stars of the show, creating beautiful events that run the gamut.  I\\'m thrilled to have found my home away from home in Georgetown.;We held a birthday party for my mother-in-law at the club. The staff, food, and accommodations were perfect for the occasion. What an amazing opportunity to experience American history with great food. I plan to host more parties at this venue.;Beautiful space for a party. Great staff;Decent Italian place. Good food, good service. Better than popular Italian place across the street \"tomate\". This is the real deal. For some reason, the atmosphere and staff reminded me of the movie \"The Big Night\".

Service was slow.;Food and service, excellent;Amazing tapas and friendly atmosphere!;Disappointed with the food and the prices were just ridiculous for tapas.;(Translated by Google) Honestly, white potatoes do not come close to the true flavor, the other tapas nothing out of the ordinary ... I would not return. Without being very demanding, it is not a place where I can feel myself eating real Spanish food, although I understand that the ingredients may not have the quality of Mediterranean food. Something more of flavor and quality could be expected.\\n\\n(Original)\\nHonestamente las patatas bravas ni se acercan al verdadero sabor, las otras tapas nada fuera de lo comun...no volver√≠a.

So, my Monday night dinner buddy and I went here for some good old fast casual Lebanese food. It was a decent experience, but we won\\'t be back.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is like most fast casual restaurants with plenty of seating. You can build your own kabob or you can order one they make for you. I had the chicken kabob and it was okay. It has french fries inside, but it lacked significant flavor. Same goes for my baklava ($1.50 for a TINY piece). My buddy got the shawarma, which lacked flavor. He had to order an extra dip to give it some taste to it.\\n\\nAll in all it wasn\\'t the worst experience, but we won\\'t be back.;I got a delicious chicken shawarma from this restaurant. I would love to come again. Also, I received a special respect from the staff.;Great food !

Prices are a little higher than other locations\\n\\n7. Amazon doesn\\'t give you a reciept or charge immediately. This further supports my idea that the store is simply reviewing purchases after the fact. Since there\\'s no reciept, and I didn\\'t record the prices for what I purchased there\\'s no way to know if the charge will be accurate. Amazon can increase prices and there\\'s no way to know unless you\\'re prepared.\\n\\nBasically this is a worse version of any convience store. Lack of selection, lack of prepared foods, no idea of the charges.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in a hurry, go to a 7/11, CVS, gas station etc. If you are hungry go to a real grocery store.\\n\\nIf you want to give Bezos more money to continue to exploit employees and waste it on sub orbital flights with a poorly designed rocket, then go to Amazon Fresh;The staff was very friendly and helpful.;No more check out lines!!!

(DR. was great) but after the exam, the service woman told me the price was $257 because it was comprehensive and a free pair of contacts. I said I wasn\\'t going to pay more than what I was told, and she suddenly lowered it to $197. I was then given the option to leave, without my prescription and had to take the \"free\" contacts out of my eyes. ISo I did.\\n\\nTerrible place. Move on to something else. Do not recommend.;I was SHOCKED when I came here to leave a review and saw all the negative reviews.  I had such a wonderful and great experience at this location.  I just became an active full-time employee at my current job and I was waiting for all my medical cards to physically arrive in the mail, but desperately needed needed an eye exam because I had run out of contacts and needed an updated prescription.  Elena, I believe is her name, was SO helpful.  She contacted me when she couldn\\'t find my vision insurance and followed up with me thoroughly up until my appointment just to let me know she was still looking into it and she was doing everything she could to make sure they located my insurance.  I took a wrong turn getting off the metro and was late to my appointment, but when I arrived, they were VERY kind and accommodated me.  Every single employee there greeted me, asked how I was doing, and made friendly conversation as I waited for different aspects of my appointment. The optometrist was great and knowledgeable. I received my lenses in the allotted time-frame they gave me and I also got complimentary sunglasses. I have NO CLUE why anyone would have a negative experience here.  It is some of the best customer service I have ever received in a medical office.;Had an eye exam and contact lenses fitted here and it was a great experience all around. I wish I could thank people by name, but everyone I encountered from the optometrist to the employee who trained me to put in contacts were very kind and patient. I\\'m glad this office is in my neighborhood.;The eye doctor here made me get a cheap brand of contacts that don\\'t support astigmatism and said it would be okay to wear once in a while. I thought I wouldn\\'t notice a difference but they\\'re just terrible. I intend to go back and run them for a proper set of contacts.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m trying to get a return but am told I can\\'t since I bought over 6 months ago. They also refuse to even sell me different contacts until I pay for another examination despite having a current and valid prescription. I understand the reasoning that eyes change, but it\\'s just unreasonable and devious to give someone contacts, admitting they may not work very well and then not allowing one to return. All I want is functional contact lenses. I\\'m $300 in the hole because I was misled. Malpractice sounds about right.\\n\\nEdit: I did in fact contact them about the issue like they commented below and they refused to do anything to help, so I\\'m confused why they would tell me to reach out.;I had a good experience. The appointment was easy to schedule and started on time. The staff was friendly and explained the charges before the exam started.

I came here for a gel manicure and they did it quickly and well. What I love about this place is how real and honest they were despite being a pretty busy salon. I got my nails done by someone who seems to be a co-owner of the place and I liked how honest she was with me about running a business.

The line was quite long so I figured it was a pretty decent spot. The line went relatively quietly but I wasn‚Äôt impressed. The food was extremely salty and rather tasteless. I was sad to discover the cafe didn‚Äôt have WiFi so I had to pack up and head to a different coffee shop. The pricing was quite affordable, which lead to my two star rating but I won‚Äôt be returning.;I will never go back. So I heard about this place and figured that I would give it a try. First, if you don\\'t speak Spanish, good luck. I decided that I would get the sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin. They show it on the board and says the price is $4.05. I get no cheese as shown in the pictures and they charge me $4.55, I guess even though they show the item with a picture on an English muffin, they want to screw you for an extra 50 cents. The sausage is bland, the muffin soggy because it wasn\\'t toasted. First time here, last time here.;Worst customer service ever. They don‚Äôt like big orders. They told me to wait just before I put in\\nmy order. Then had the nerve to put all the breakfast items away in front of me and speak Spanish as if I couldn‚Äôt understand them.

They are very friendly and will always give advice on what to do if you find something.

I couldn\\'t just leave this baby there to become food for area stray cats looking for a quick snack so I ran into my house for a small box and some paper towels so that I could vet him safely into the box; once he was secure i googled \"wild bird\" rescue in NW, DC which is how I\\'d found these kind folks. When I arrived I was promptly greeted and given a short form to complete and I asked the lady if I could check on the baby bird later and i was given a caed with the birds code which I could reference when I called back. I called a few hours later and happily leared that his breed was identified as finch and that after resting and allowing his feathers to dry he was all set and flew out rescue centers doors to join a new family of finches.

No dental work is completely pain free, but Dr. Kirunda comes as close to it as possible.;I love this dentist. He fixed shoddy work performed by my last dentist and had kept my mouth in great shape. 10/10 would recommend.;I honestly cannot say enough good things about Dr. Kirunda & his staff. What a great experience...at THE DENTIST! How often do you get to say that?! Making the appointment was quick and the woman who answered the phone was so sweet and helpful. Everyone greeted me politely when I walked in today. The practice is clean, the waiting area is comfortable with HGTV on (yay!) and complimentary tea/water/coffee. Dr. K cleans your teeth HIMSELF. What other dentist is that hands-on? He explained exactly what he was doing, told me when something might feel a little sensitive, and thoroughly went over my x-rays and his suggestion for my next services. I am SO happy I found such a great dentist in DC. Very grateful for the excellent service today! I know I\\'m in good hands.;I was pleased with the service I got today!;My 6 months appointment Monday was quick and Dr. Kirunda didn\\'t have to do much other than a 6 months cleaning and I got a good report.  Thanks.;Parking can be tough, so come early. They take amerihealth;The absolute best!;The staff here were helpful, friendly, and quick. The pickup and drop off processes were efficient and their indoor store allows you to buy the last minute things needed for a move. I\\'d of course recommend using a smaller, or local company to move, but if you can\\'t this U-Haul is a good option. You can park your car there for free in their parking lot during the day while you move and the whole thing was pretty hassle-free.;They really work to find the best storage for your needs and customer service is good!!;Great place for a truck rental and/or moving supplies. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I prefer them over any other locations in the area.;Watch out and be sure to take your own verification pictures. We returned our vehicle with the same gas it had at the time of rental and were charged for a full tank. The staff is unhelpful and incredibly rude. Document everything so you have proof when returning your vehicle and they try to charge you extra.;I cannot recommend this place to a friend due to the face the guy who attended the returns area Charles is rude, unprofessional and is smoking in people faces offensively.  Has a hideous attitude towards good working people. Everyone else was AWESOME;The place was a bit hard to find, but the people were very nice and helpful.;Great customer service, truck was clean and on time. My 3rd time and they really have it down;Good place to get a rental. Well stocked and we\\'ll located. Their vans are brand new and really good!;Quick and easy with above and beyond service! I was able to rent the truck in 10 minutes the night before so that when I drove up I contactless picked up the truck and went! Drop off was done in a safe and distanced manner. All trucks are thoroughly disinfected before next rental. All this at an unbelievable low price.;Make sure you take lots of pictures when you drop it off and when you return it. We were charged $150 for a \"broken light\" that we definitely did not do. On the receipt it says the incident happened at 6:30 pm, but we returned the van at noon. The person we called told us that 6:30 was just the time that they got a chance to inspect the vehicle and see that the light was damaged. We took pictures when we picked it up, but it looked exactly the same when we dropped it off so we didn\\'t bother. That\\'s on us for trusting this place, but they didn\\'t have to do that to us.;Customer service needs to be more friendly;Customer service was good. Clerks are knowledgeable and easy to talk to.;Great for in-town moves in the DMV... especially when you\\'re picking up furniture for your girlfriend Casack;New ways of conctless return of rental truck..nice uhaul app;Staff that was present when I dropped off my u-haul was unprofessional, argumentative, and rude. Also  e warned of the deceptive fee structure. Our 19.99 a day van for two days with minimal milage ended up at $160.\\n\\nIf you have any other options for somewhere else.;Note to any renters ask to see or check truck before signing.....I signed out a truck saying the tank was full and miles she also different.;I\\'ve used this location a few times with good results. If you get there right as they open, you should be able to pick up your truck/van quickly. If you wait until later in the day - plan some time.  The staff was fine, not overly friendly, but not rude either.;They\\'re poor because if you miss a payment they will not let you get into your unit.;Super organized, friendly staff, clean vehicles.;Nice and helpful staff;Great service and very convenient!;Customer service was Pleasant enough but I did have a hard time finding the truck pick up area... the other staff seem like they didn\\'t really care that much they were okay not to helpful. Truck was in good condition. Service was quick for me.;This U-haul runs like a machine. It was super easy to reserve, pick-up and drop off the U-haul and they answered all my questions before I even had the chance to ask them. The facility is also easy to get to and leave from, so driving a big moving truck for the firs time was less intimidating;Staff is always helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I\\'ve had a storage unit there for several years, and have never had any problems. Only problem area: parking is horrible. Not enough of it, especially if you are loading/unloading.;Very busy place;Third rental in a month and this place is on their game! Fast in and out. Clean truck. Very professional. Best U-haul in US. Check in online.;Double stacked lockers/units, with small doors for medium and small lockers, makes it hard to put a couch into them.  I would look at other spots.  Although good place to pick up packing material - even has a tv cases;Great clean place.;Im giving 5 stars bc it still has my stuff in it. But it does not have a temp controlled environment.;Made payment on storage;Excellent service and convenient location.  I checked in online so the entire process to get the truck and be on my way took less than 15 minutes.\\n\\nThe location is less than 10 minutes walking from the RI metro stop.\\n\\nAnd the truck was brand new with 1k miles on it!;U-Haul storage is always good in case of need, but this location has trouble beyond the patience of regular humans. Their system is frozen most of the time, which is discouraging when you have Sat 30th and Sun 31st to move, wasting 3h of your time waiting just to get the storage unit contract, without the possibility of overtime access to the storage unit because it is not available for the storage building. U-Haul is a good addition to my life, but this location isn\\'t;Horrible experience thru the mobile app for an after-hours pickup and dropoff, on what is supposed to be a seamless process. The app is extremely clunky and regularly doesn\\'t register your clicks to allow you onto the next page.\\n\\nYou need to submit all kinds of info upon arrival, not before, so prepare for a lengthy delay at pickup time despite the fact that they could\\'ve just had you submit everything earlier. Someone on their end needs to verify it in real-time, including calling a friend or family member just to verify that you indeed exist and are renting a truck. Unsure how this is a real security measure but regardless.\\n\\nThen they gave me the lockbox code to get the truck keys, but the app was so clunky that that page disappeared before I could read it. So I promptly spent the next 20 minutes in the pouring rain on hold with their customer service line, just to get the damn lockbox code. The app thought I\\'d already started driving, so my only option there was to request roadside assistance (dysfunctional app wouldn\\'t let me submit a request for that either).\\n\\nAdd it all up and you\\'ve got a terrible user experience. Find any other truck or equipment rental service whenever possible.;Excellent storage facility in all the time my property has been stored there. Try them for yourself!;Terrible management and the Gen. Mgr named Ousman is THE WORST!!!!! This location would rather take your money before providing a \"complete\" service to you!;This is a great US haul outlet. Shops in Md do not always have more than 1 of each size cargo trailers in stock.;Very happy with my moving experience. Not a lot of hidden fees, good service, and decent location (walking distance from the Rhode Island Avenue metro station) makes this U-Haul a good choice for in-town moving;I love this place,  I love working here and helping people...üòçüòçüòç;Good service but very slow, it took me almost one hour to get my truck which was already reserved online;Conveniently located but parking is an issue in the area.;Poor service. Called about donating furniture, and they failed to inform me that donations can be left in the storage facility!;Great customer service;Good deal...;They put a hold on your funds without telling you. And the when you ask to speak to a manager he is rude and nasty telling you that you have to call your financial institution;Great service.;There were dead rats,magets,and rat poop all over my belongings;Very friendly and proficient staff.;Everyone is so nice;Stop by to get treated like you\\'re an idiot by rude staff!;great service;Good location great place;Very tiny storage area and no parking.;Excellent service;Knowledgeable and helpful.;very convenient service;Service isn\\'t that good;Everything was as described, friendly staff;Great storage;Very friendly staff, hooked everything up for me;Slowest customer service ever;Busy at weekend;Cheese pizza for my teen majority of the time and this location makes their pizzas better than many other Little Caesars locations near by ...but our last pizza was burnt ( hot and ready ) I didn\\'t return it but I don\\'t expect it again.. I had dozen of great ones!! And the guy that normally works the register evenings/ nights  WASN\\'T THERE but he has great customer service, I don\\'t think he would have given that pizza out ..will return;Very fast and consistent.  Pizza here is always decent enough for something quick - and a whole large pizza is just $5.99!  It\\'s not great - or fancy - or dine-in - but then again, it\\'s not supposed to be.;The food is good. Never had any issues but I have to wait for my pizza to be cooked when the slogan says \"Hot n Ready\". Other than that we cool;Place was clean, folks were nice, pizza was Great !! And, the price was good.;I enjoy the food it\\'s great. I can\\'t get enough. I am always back for more.;OMG...The worst customer service experience ever! Being from the Midwest, I was SO excited to learn that a new Little Caesars was coming to NW DC. Maybe 3 weeks after its grand opening, I paid a visit to this location and I vowed to never return. When 1st entering the store, I was not welcomed by any type of greeting. The girl at the register pretty much stared at me while I was deciding on what to order as if I was holding her up.\\n\\nWhen inquiring about the Hot and Ready pizzas, I asked how long the pizzas had been sitting out and she said they had just come out the oven. I also asked about the crazy bread and she said the same thing. So I placed my order, received my food and it was very luke warm. I politely asked her if they could make a fresh pizza and set of breadsticks for me and she said , \"These ARE fresh\" with the biggest attitude. So we went back and forth a little bit and eventually she asked the cook to make a fresh order, accompanied by an eye roll. When I got my food, it was the sloppiest thing I had ever seen in life.\\n\\nI then asked her for a refund and she said a manager needed to be there in order for this to happen. I asked her to call the manager if he/she was not there and she claimed they weren\\'t answering the phone. Long story short, I tried calling the store the next day, no response. Then I called district and got a callback right away with refund info and a free pizza offer. I declined the free pizza offer and assured them that I would never return to this particular location again.;Good place take and out quickly although the  cashier wasn\\'t friendly but other than that a good place;Great Pizza ever it\\'s good not too oily...;The pizza was not hot and it was naste will never eat from them again;I usually like ordering from here, but my order just arrived with one incorrect item and another missing item.

Delivery itself is fairly quick for DC as well. I\\'ve had many of the standards and they\\'ve all been good, my last order however I decided to try Chow Mein for the very first time it was AWESOME, j don\\'t know if this is indictive of the fish though since I\\'ve never bothered to order it anywhere else. I usually stick to the Szechuan dishes, but I\\'ve had many of the other offerings and liked them as well. The Wonton soup is good, not the best and I\\'ve had the egg drop soup, but again it was my first order of it and it was nice, not my cup of tea. This is how I feel about the dishes at any asian place I\\'ve been to and tried like hot garlic sauce dishes, I\\'ve had it at many places in DC and I just don\\'t like it, but Szechuan house at least has the garlic I can see and the vegetables and meat are fresh. Living in SW there aren\\'t as many options but Szechuan house should be at the top of your choices.;This is my favorite takeout Chinese food in DC. It\\'s just the perfect comfort food that you want on a rainy night to eat too much with friends (or by yourself) and watch movies. Everything I\\'ve tried has been delicious and satisfying. I also ate in once, and the service was great! Definitely recommend this place.;This is the best Chinese takeout in the Waterfront/Navy Yard/Eastern Market area.  The food is great quality, the employees are nice and helpful, and the delivery is prompt. I‚Äôm impressed that they always read my extra instructions in the online order and follow through. This is the only Chinese takeout I will order in the area. :);Excellent take-out, friendly staff. Really, really, good General Tao\\'s Tofu. Easy to miss if you aren\\'t looking for it.;Great little, local takeout and delivery! Occasionally been going here throughout the past year.

But I won\\'t be eating here again.;Fun store of great gifts with a helpful staff. They held our purchases at the front desk so we didn\\'t have to hold them while we decided what we wanted.

No estimated wait time.\\nThere\\'s 10 interview windows and 3 intake windows but only 1 intake window open and 2 interview windows so running at less then 25%.\\nWhy even be open if you can\\'t process ppl in a remotely timely manner?

Overall a good way to spend time cutting through the red tape!;Ashley  in cubicle C was really helpful, listened and she is calm and a soothing voice. Thank you Ash. I came immediately when they opend at 9am. So the line was not that bad.;Extremely slow service. It‚Äôs not true about Monday mornings being the fastest service day. I‚Äôve been there today because I read the other reviews. Every damn day are the same with the line that take ages and then waiting again for your number being called is taking eons. Expect your time here to be 2-3 hours at average. The place also stinks and filled with flies because of the kind of people that come here for service. I don‚Äôt want to come back here again.;They are very inexperienced!

From the optician to sales there is nice service.\\n\\nBut the buy 2 pair of glasses for half off the price and / or the \"Buy one pair get one free\" deals appear to be nothing but a sales scheme, no real deal is possible. There is no reason I see to be disqualified from the sales specials if I\\'ve paid $300-$500 out of pocket.  It shouldn\\'t matter how much my insurance covers. \"Restrictions apply\" of course.   Most know buying glasses completely out of pocket with a prescription is very expensive at most stores. So where\\'s the deal?\\n\\nSo my recent purchase from Visionworks is probably my last. Buyer be aware don\\'t go in expecting the \"buy one get one free\" special to be a real thing;We had a great experience.staff was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.

Last year when my daughter & I visited this location it was great! Today that all changed when we showed up for our appointments and were told it was MANDATORY for us to take some specialized test that was on sale for $19.99 to even receive an eye exam. This is after waiting 25 minutes for our appointments! i have health insurance but, was denied service if i didn\\'t agree to pay $40! That\\'s like my doctor refusing to examine me if I don\\'t pay a thermo-body scan! The rationale provided to me was that due to an extended length of time between visits due to COVID, the company made it a requirement! That\\'s ludicrous! We only visit once a year anyway so that doesn\\'t make sense! i don\\'t even wear glasses. Why would I pay for a fancy test! Sounds to me like a business just trying to recoup funds during a pandemic. Sooo disappointed! This place is near my home & now I have to find somewhere else. I will also report them because I don\\'t believe it\\'s legal to deny someone with insurance service because they won\\'t pay for an additional & completely unnecessary test!;Excellent customer service!

I rented a truck for a day to pick up furniture and it saved so much time and energy by having the truck as opposed to other delivery options.

Once we made or selection she rang us up and was most courteous . She said she had only been there for 3 weeks and did not hesitate to ask for assistance from her colleagues when she was unsure. Then the manager Chris came got the boxes and carried them to the car for us. As a long time retail sales person I appreciate excellent customer service and this facility\\'s staff are spot on.

It\\'s the bottom floor of a beautiful row house and has any kitchen need you can imagine from state shaped cutting boards to fancy wine glasses.;Lovely little shop that has some unique items that make it more than a kitchen goods store. One more than one occasion, I\\'ve gone in for the states-shaped cookie cutters to send to friends, and have sent others there who are looking for gifts for their favorite bakers. They also have an excellent range of gifts for kids who want to get into cooking, with lots of small tools for tiny hands.;Amazing store.   The staff is super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  My wife and I did our wedding registry through the store, which was a great experience, and many of our family members heaped praise on Leah, the owner.;Wonderful kitchen gadgets and some gourmet foods, nice knives,  high quality stuff and very, very friendly people.  Could\\'t be closer to Eastern Market Metro.  Best of all their own designed , knife fork and spoon DC flag for people who love to cook  (play with their food) and love DC this is a must have.;Carefully selected kitchen items with  knowledgeable folks and friendly atmosphere;Love this place!

Lots of baking and ice cream tools;Great Service, great selection!!;Great kitchen supply store, in the middle of SE.;Lovely little kitchen novelty shop;Thia place has everything.;I‚Äôm done with this place. Two days in a row came in to buy pain killers and couldn‚Äôt get anyone to open the cages they‚Äôre locked inside. It doesn‚Äôt even matter that the employees are friendly, this store must be way understaffed when you can‚Äôt even get medicine in a drugstore!;CVS is like purgatory. Nothing against this particular CVS but every CVS I go into is Bland\\'s the service is terrible and I assume it\\'s because they\\'re not paying any of their employees enough to give them incentive for it. everything is overpriced and even on the app I\\'m never sure if I\\'m going to leave feeling like I got what I needed out of it.;I\\'ve shopped here from time to time - staff was very nice. Products were available and not reasonably priced (although not as low as some other convenience store locations);I feel as though it\\'s your regular CVS. Very convenient location, right by the Georgia Ave/Petworth Location. May not be the best as far as having everything, but I have gone there for basic needs and not had an issue. Not much store assistance. Walked around multiple times looking for a cream, maybe passed and employee twice and wasn\\'t offered any assistance...but overall nothing but regular CVS experiences.;Friendliest CVS Staff I‚Äôve ever encountered, but there‚Äôs always one cashier. The wait in line can be very long, especially without self checkout.;Pharmacist Mehret is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.;The staff here is friendly, but this store is very drab. It feels like a prison inside and the ‚Äòdecor‚Äô leaves quite a bit to be desired. It could definitely use a facelift like some of the CVS and Walgreens locations downtown.;I  been a customer for years and I especially like,\\nThe greetings I get from pharmacy staff.\\nAlways service with a smile I been in pain when I arrived, but when I leave I don\\'t think about the pain  because where just like family.\\nOverall great store!.;Extremely poor service.  Pharmacy service has gone downhill over the last 6 months.  Pharmacy does not pickup calls. I had to literally call the store mamager to inquire abt prescriptions on several occasions.  Robo calls stopped completely.  Text notifications sporadic.;Store is kind of a mess. Quality of service varies. I don\\'t actively avoid this CVS like I do the one in Columbia Heights.;While this is a fairly new CVS, the service is only average.;The pharmacy here is the worst, though most CVS pharmacies suck. They are ALWAYS understaffed and there\\'s always some problem. Never fill your prescription here.;Just a basic CVS.;Food quality is pretty good. You pick up meal plans, purchase frozen meals, buy smoothies or actual prepared food all at a convenient price. It can be an overwhelming experience because there is not a lot of guidance going in. If you can self navigate or aren\\'t afraid to ask questions you can make this place work for your needs.;I was walking down H street looking for a place to eat a couple hours before the gym, and stumbled on this Mecca for anyone intentionally eating and drinking to lose, maintain OR build their body. They offer wide range of fresh and frozen meals, as well as many types of healthy drinks. I got 2 frozen meals (which they  were happy to heat up for me to eat there), Cajun ground beef and Asian shredded beef for $7.50 each. That\\'s a great deal compared to other food prep services, on top of which they offer 1 free when you buy 5 at a time. LOVE the \"what\\'s your vision\" sheets. This place makes it easy to meet my goals without endless shopping and weighing of ingredients;If you are health conscious and are interested in having a convenient option in the city then I highly recommend Clean Eatz. I went during the dinner hour (6:00PM)and quickly parked and had my dinner and also a meal to go in about 20 minutes, my food was hot and tasty..I purchased the Watch your Waist with Salmon and I got a togo meal to prepare later. You should definitely try if in the DMV...#Mealprep to goüëç;No complaints here. Can\\'t wait to try out the meal plans.;This was our first time try it out clean eatz I use a Groupon the food was great I highly recommend there protein French toast my daughter loved it I myself had the bowl which was great as well we will definitely be going back I\\'m glad to see that there is a place like this in my neighborhood and I don\\'t have to travel so far;Wow, the quality of this place has really gone down. 50% of the time they mess up your order, their smoothies aren\\'t made from real fruit and LOOK how burnt my pancakes are. Can\\'t believe they had the nerve to deliver these to me.;Came in on #MLKDAY! and was not disappointed. Staff is patient and on point, and the food is delicious and not to be missed. Clean Eatz is now in rotation on my go-to spot list.;A very good variety of healthy options. Also can custom order meal plans for any dietary restrictions.;Very unique!!! Easy, no frills menu!

Some items are bland, so order carefully.;I like the healthy choices.when I came back the store close or maybe change.;Working long hours in the hospital or clinic had deterred my healthy lifestyle choices.

Waited 20+ minutes just to order a drink. Won\\'t be going back any time soon.;I used to go there when i was heading to other clubs in the same general area back in the 80s and 90s when I lived in DC and Va.;(Translated by Google) Strong drinks .... heyyyy!\\n\\n(Original)\\nStrong drinks....heyyyy!;Loved the food and libations.

Great people.;Excellent salmon with shrimp and calamari.;Nice food.;Nice and clean;Excellent venue\\nBackdrop of the Capitol\\nA Capitpol  Experience;Awesome view. Great place for a corporate event during the summer.;Beautiful views and location. The food was really good too. It\\'s a rooftop and is an amazing venue with great service and food.;I was here for a conference dinner on the rooftop. The food was lackluster and ran out multiple times. the event was by reservation only so it was not as if Capitol View had no idea on how many patrons to expect. The two bars that were on the rooftop were cash only and hard to navigate towards. The bathrooms were also located a fair distance away. After a bit of socializing (like an hour), many of my peers decided to go to another venue.;Beautiful rooftop location provides lovely views of the Capitol in all its glory.;Spectacular views. Great venue;Beautiful place.;nice  for venues;Layla Lounge is the place to be. Open space, cool atmosphere, what\\'s not to love. I was here on Monday for Munchies Monday. We play cannabis bingo and have a great time.;Always 420 events, great atmosphere;I went for a very disorganized event... So this may be somewhat biased... But the venue was kind of dark, nothing looked new or modern, upstairs and downstairs are not that big, weird location.;This place was horrible. The advertised open bar and buffet never happened despite paying a fee. Straight up scam club. Avoid at all cost!;Need a extra floor wider space for venue...;Awesome vibes;To hood for me üòÆüòîüòî;Loved it!;Horrible;I love Margot she\\'s the best & her staff is friendly as well .

Well stocked and staff is pleasant.;Nice store usually quick and attentive.;Expensive. Try Fairmont down the street.;Love it;There price are fair.;Staff was friendly and efficient. Work related drug test was completed in only a few minutes. There are a few parking spots next to the building but the street behind allows free parking for up to 2 hours. Plenty of neighborhood parking. Also conveniently located near the metro station.;Staff was very polite. Keep in mind the hours for Physicians is in fact different and is 9:00am to 2:45pm. Otherwise I have no complaints, great and conveniently located service.;Quick polite service!!!;Poor customer service short-term quality products reasonable price I\\'m not sure the health department will pass this place though;Nice store 4 women 2 shop 4 different items, they just don\\'t have good clothes or accessories 4 plus size women.;I went to get my daughter uniform pants and under clothes from this store.

After work can be busy but the line move somewhat quickly try to get there as close to 5 as you can, the closer to 6 p.m. the more likely there\\'s usually at least 5 people waiting. Saturday morning when they open at 11 is also a great time to come. I prefer this location over the u Street location because of the technicians.;First time client and she did an amazing job and listened to my needs. While it is $15 for eyebrows which is more expensive than my usual spots I will be returning. It\\'s convenient, right by work so I don\\'t have to compromise time with my husband and kids on the weekend.;My eyebrows are always on point after leaving the shop. I love my Threader. She\\'s friendly, professional and has an eye for perfection!;Excellent service. Rarely have to wait; when I do, the wait is short. Price is reasonable.;Good local place in dc for eyebrow threading, although it‚Äôs a bit dirty walking there, underneath the stairs in the basement .;I had to come back twice and the service wasn\\'t that good.;The food tasted great once it was prepared. We always get the stuffed crust cheese pizza and wings. There seems to be an error with the app. Our order was placed at 602pm and still not ready an hour later at 702pm when the \\'track my order\\' feature stated my food had been \\'picked up\\'. The employees seemed to be stressed on this particular Friday night and the female in the front making pizzas with her pants half way down seemed to not be in the best spirits but still trying to get everyone\\'s orders out the door.\\nOur order was not complete with the sides so you may have to remind them but you will get great tasting food.;I usually order from the 11th street store and am happy with their pizza tonight however I tried to order their $10 special of two large two topping pizza for takeout online.Their site would only let me order one pizza and wouldn\\'t let order the second.After multiple attempts online I called the store to order the \"special\" .The woman t as king my order said ok and repeated the order back to me, and told me it would be 20 minutes until the oder was ready. I get to the store and she rings my oder up and tells me it\\'s now $27 and change. I\\'m like \"that\\'s not what t was listed online and what\\'s the problem\"? She tells me there\\'s tax and I\\'m saying \"Not $12 or more in tax\"! Then she says ,\"well that\\'s the online special and you called the order in\". I\\'m now explaining I\\'ve called in orders before and that\\'s never been a problem, then she goes on to say \"well our policy has changed\" ! So a few more seconds of conversation goes nowhere and now I\\'m angry AND hungry so I  pay for the pizzas and leave.  Papa John\\'s has just lost another customer an now get home to find out there\\'s little bacon on my chicken  and bacon pizza. All in all a frustrating and disappointing experience!;Ordered a pizza at 6:30. Was told it would take an hour. Driver showed up at 7:47. By the time I read the box and saw that it was someone else\\'s pizza, she had driven off. I called the store and they said they would send her back. It has now been 30 more minutes, nearly 2 hours since I ordered, and when I called the driver 10 minutes ago all she would say was she was \"on her way.\"\\n\\nNever again.;Good pizza, maybe theres street parking out front.;They are so unsanitary..

It is a fun hang out spot, with great music.\\n\\nAll photo credits go to @girlavalon;We ordered a reasonably-priced bottle of wine that turned out to be unavailable, so staff served us a comparable bottle that was twice the price without letting us know. Service was OK.;Love this wine bar! An excellent selection and great service. They have patio and indoor seating.;Good selection of wine. Interesting concepts. Great knowledgeable staff. Doing well with keeping people safe but can‚Äôt wait to see at full capacity.;Very friendly staff. Really appreciate being able to sit out on the sidewalk. We ordered a variety of wines and a few appetizers. Enjoyed the variety and quality of the food and drinks available. Great spot to stop in before having dinner any any of the nearby restaurants.;Terrible service but great location;PROFITEER WARNING for most pet owners, man\\'s best friend is another member of the family and deserves the best care, but you need to be alert to profiteers, some of the veterinarians at this place are out to make an extra buck, they pad the bill with unnecessary tests and procedures. Speaking from experience, I suggest you approach this otherwise excellent veterinary clinic with caution  -- never hurts to question your doctor so why not your dog or cat\\'s.;Dr Murdoch is very capable, compassionate, and communicates clearly recommendations and options. My Buddy cat is recovering very quickly from an urgent procedure. Everyone else I encountered was professional and helpful.;In the first few years that this clinic opened, I had to put down my cat. I went there because it was close and I could see how they handled me and my pet.  They gave him the ultimate dose before telling me that this would be it!  So I had no chance to say good-bye to him or pet him!  I was really upset.\\n\\nToday, 2016, I needed their cooperation to work with another vet\\'s office to get some pain medication today for my new cat who has cancer.  I called three times in the a.m. and never got a response.  It just went to voice mail and no one ever bothered to call me back.\\n\\nI\\'d like to say something good about this clinic, but with these experiences, I simply cannot.   They do not exhibit the sensitivity and care that I would and should expect from any veterinary clinic.;This place misrepresented itself, and made untruthful statements both verbally and in writing.\\n\\nThe practice manager, Richard Cohen, admitted that his wife and friends work at Friendship Hospital for Animals, which negligently/maliciously gave my cat dog medication and caused him to suffer. My cat had to be put to sleep as a result of the negligence of Friendship Hospital for Animals.\\n\\nFriendship Hospital for Animals was under investigation for animal abuse/cruelty and Dupont Veterinary Clinic provided Friendship Hospital my cat\\'s clinical records without my authorization, despite the fact that they initially claimed that it was good that Friendship is being investigated for animal cruelty and promised not to provide my cat\\'s clinical records. Dupont\\'s agents were aware that I attended Friendship Hospital with the police in order to retrieve my cat and they were instructed not to provide any information to Friendship. Dupont claimed that they have no relationship with Friendship, yet the practice manager later admits to his ties to Friendship.\\n\\nThe unlawful conduct of Dupont should be addressed.;Great place although a bit expensive. However they outlined the cost every step of the way and Dr. Dan was fantastic!;Outside of the parking aspect, a great place to take your pets if you want quality care!;Alley has some very useful spaces which I\\'ve been to several times. The startup I\\'m with used it when we needed a conference room and they had a bigger space for a large meetup presentation I attended.

I appreciate the customer service here, especially Tyler.  On a previous rental, when I got lost, he help me navigate to their location.  I was dealing with a serious medical emergency  regarding a parent about a hour away and needed to get back my rental.  Tyler was kind to say that I can stay at the hospital and get the car back as soon as the emergency was settled. If you have ever had a number of things go wrong at once and someone makes one of those things better, it means the world.\\nI read some of the other reviews here, for example, when people have to wait for the reps at the desk, yes that can be frustrating. But the reps take you down the elevator to the garage and help you find your rental.  Its is a large hotel location, it can take time.  My rental has smelled a little of smoke in the past, I just rolled the window down for 10 minutes and it was fine.  I do not smoke but we live in DC and I am not sure how the reps would prevent people from smoking in the cars while using them.\\nI have paid extra in rental just to rent at this location because the reps are very nice, the cars are consistently in great shape and the location is near Dupont metro (for heading to and from the rental), I recommend this Hertz.;You have to walk back through the Hilton lobby to find the small desk. They got me in and out pretty quick. It was an easy experience, and much more convenient than going to DCA if you live on the red line. The car was nice and clean. I would go back.;Megan is awesome.

The same cannot be said of this location.\\n\\nAt this point we\\'ve visited twice. The first time we came, we were not informed of their \"dropoff only\" policy, and it was raining. We and our cats were left outside in the rain for 10 minutes before they came and brought them in. They tried to make up for that with a complimentary nail trim, which was nice so we thought we\\'d give them another chance.\\n\\nThe second time, we dropped them off for a teeth cleaning today. We were told they could not eat 12 hours before; that\\'d we\\'d receive a call from the vet in the afternoon informing us of their progress; and that we could expect to pick them up around 3-4pm.\\n\\n5 o\\'clock rolled around, and we\\'d heard nothing all day. We called the office and were told the cats were still under treatment and that we could expect to hear from them before the office closed at 6.\\n\\n6 o\\'clock rolled around and we heard nothing. We called back and were told that one of the cats was still under care. At this point, knowing my cats likely hadn\\'t been fed all day, I asked what exactly the vet had been doing with my cats given we had dropped them off almost 12 hours prior to this call. The representative said that Dr. Joseph Ianniello - the vet overseeing the procedures - had likely shifted our cats\\' appointments around depending on the different walk-ins and drop-offs of the day. At no point were we ever updated on this, and at no point did the doctor seem to care that two hungry cats might deserve to be treated at their allotted times so they wouldn\\'t have to go 24 hours without food unnecessarily.\\n\\nWhen it\\'s all boiled down, the simple fact was that expectations were set and not met: we were told our cats had a morning appointment (their procedure didn\\'t start until at least 5pm); we were told we\\'d get a call from the vet (he skipped out and never called us before ending his shift. Thanks Dr. Ianniello!!); we were told we\\'d pick our cats up between 3-4pm (we just got home at 7pm).\\n\\nIf you can\\'t meet expectations that YOU set, don\\'t set them. Period. We will be calling tomorrow (since none of the doctors were available to speak with us) to cancel our wellness plan with them. \"Wellness\" implies they care for your pets, when it\\'s clear from this recent experience that your pet is nothing but a number and a fat wad of cash to them.;They took really good care of my lil Fella;The personnel is awesome.  Mr. Cook gave exceptional customer service.;Love that they really keep you informed. The vet spoke w/me after seeing my dogs and was more thorough than any vet I\\'d seen before in the DMV (City Paws & Takoma vet clinic, to be exact.)\\nDr. McFarland and Ulysses, plus a young woman whose name I regretfully did not catch helped me and my dog that day.

The first few times, I was pleased and actually felt the services were better than high end salons that provide the same services. However, the past few times the services have been inconsistent and highly dependent on the individual providing the services. Unevenly colored brows. Bluntly ended brows. Lashes that are not anywhere black. I definitely don\\'t go out of my way to come here anymore and often find myself nearby, needing tinting, and still not stopping in.;My favorite place to get my brows done. They always have a spot without any reservations, they are fast and good price. I always leave happy with my perfect brows. I don\\'t have any preference, always go with whoever is available and never left disappointed. Highly recommend!;I have been a customer for over a year, having eyebrow tinting and brow threading.  I recently added facial waxing.  I had a tinting of the brow the 24th of December and noticed that the dye was FADING rather quickly, within 4 days the gray hair was back and on the 9ith day following the service I went back to the salon for them to correct.  I expected the correction to  be quick but I found A CALL TO THE OWNER was needed and I was told that if I wanted a correction it SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWO DAYS from the time of a tinting.  TINTING LAST BETWEEN 4to6 WEEKS!!!  I was tinted quickly without  paying for the service again.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BEHAVIOR and WILL RE-THINK using this salon again.  THIS IS NOT HOW TO TREAT A LOYAL CUSTOMER!;Wonderful staff and great COVID precautions taken!;The owner of the place texted me, harassing me.\\n\\nI went to Silky Smooth DC. It was the first day of  woman who was threading me and she was just trying to make conversation. She asked me about me and so I reciprocated. I found out that she\\'s been in the States for 4 years and has an 8 year old daughter. The remainder of her family husband and mother are back in Nepal and she\\'s collecting money to sponsor them to come here. She makes very little money lives off of tips cannot afford to really live in a place by herself so rents a room in somebody else\\'s house for herself and daughter.;They took me as a walk in and I was out after a threading in less than 15 mins! The staff is extremely professional and the business is very clean and nice. They even have all sorts of charges located in the waiting area which was a nice surprise.;I was pleased with the service I received. It‚Äôs a nice clean shop with wonderful customer service. I will be returning to get my eyebrows threaded again!!!;I have been there twice for my eyebrows and was totally satisfied. I would recommend Silky Smooth to anyone looking for pampering herself. The owner is friendly and the atmosphere is clean.;Best threading shop in DC... Customer service is always top notch and Krishna does the best job on my uneven eyebrows.;Silky is my go-to gal for hair removal. She really knows what she is doing, very thorough while being comforting.;Friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere. They do a great job!;Be your best..üòç;I write this review as a current member of the City Tavern Club.  I very much have enjoyed my time at CTC so far - I\\'ve had the opportunity to meet a diverse, accomplished group of members and received a warm welcome from the membership.  The club offers varied activities, ranging from interesting book talks and lectures to more social events like wine tastings and seasonal parties.  The food and wine selection is fabulous.  The building itself, c. 1796, is extremely well maintained and well-appointed with beautiful furniture and decoration on its seemingly endless floors.  The club is a lovely place to host your next get together or party and can handle events of all sizes and types.  Heather and staff are the stars of the show, creating beautiful events that run the gamut.  I\\'m thrilled to have found my home away from home in Georgetown.;We held a birthday party for my mother-in-law at the club. The staff, food, and accommodations were perfect for the occasion. What an amazing opportunity to experience American history with great food. I plan to host more parties at this venue.;Beautiful space for a party. Great staff;Decent Italian place. Good food, good service. Better than popular Italian place across the street \"tomate\". This is the real deal. For some reason, the atmosphere and staff reminded me of the movie \"The Big Night\". Check it out if you are in the area and want good italian food.;Love this place. The nicest bartenders and the strongest drinks. Well worth a visit. Tegar is a real great guy.;This is a great place with a friendly staff and good food;Great paella! Good spot for a date.;Quick eats, not too expensive;Food was mediocre. It was dead on a Saturday night which should have said something. Service was slow.;Food and service, excellent;Amazing tapas and friendly atmosphere!;Disappointed with the food and the prices were just ridiculous for tapas.;(Translated by Google) Honestly, white potatoes do not come close to the true flavor, the other tapas nothing out of the ordinary ... I would not return. Without being very demanding, it is not a place where I can feel myself eating real Spanish food, although I understand that the ingredients may not have the quality of Mediterranean food. Something more of flavor and quality could be expected.\\n\\n(Original)\\nHonestamente las patatas bravas ni se acercan al verdadero sabor, las otras tapas nada fuera de lo comun...no volver√≠a. Sin ser muy exigente no es un lugar donde pueda sentirme comiendo verdadera comida Espa√±ola aunque entiendo que los ingredientes podr√≠an no tener la calidad de la comida mediterr√°nea podr√≠an esperarse algo m√°s de sabor y calidad.;The staff was very friendly! The Braider JO is absolutely amazing on THE SLAYYY as always!;No just a braiding salon they do all types of hair with bomb results;Loved it VERY professional and the Ladies can do some HAIR!!!üòä;Went for trim. The shampoo is amazing but blowing out the hair was a bit rough. I have natural hair and it can hurt my hair when combining from the roots. She didnt cut too much of my hair so I am happy with that.;I went in a lil nervous because of how damaged my hair is. The owner Dominique hooked me up. I walked out feeling like a new woman. I never had my hair cut so low but I like it. The staff is friendly and works with a sense of urgency. The shampoo girl is really cool I love the music and different Quotes all around the shop. I will be returning soon. I had a great experience;Kim is the only person my friend goes to, shes the best. I\\'ve seen her do her styling & she never disappoints;Very dirty there they talking about you in their own language  they charge you too much money;I was a first time client, my appointment was set for 11:00am and I didn\\'t leave there until 5:00pm.;Professional, courteous and knowledgeable. Ask for Tamira;Gotta get back here.  These ladies rock!;Kia the best and the staff;Flossie my stylist bomb;Enjoyed my visit thanks to Kerry;Ok..had a few cool items;Close and convenient plus the staff is super Lit;Love the prices, just not alot of kids shoes to choose from;They had nothing I needed, and I felt like one of the workers was high;Nice store and very pricey;Nice variety of shoes for the family!;$30 for a snap back ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\\nGo ahead and close your stores..;Prices are too high, even the sales aren\\'t worth it;They had what my son was looking for;Terrible selection\\nNeed more brands of shoes;Love it;Nice;Go to spot for sneakers on sale;shoes are great....sometimes the prices are expensive.;Even after walking by Micho\\'s for the last three years, I\\'ve never been tempted to go in until I saw the 4 star rating on Yelp. So, my Monday night dinner buddy and I went here for some good old fast casual Lebanese food. It was a decent experience, but we won\\'t be back.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is like most fast casual restaurants with plenty of seating. You can build your own kabob or you can order one they make for you. I had the chicken kabob and it was okay. It has french fries inside, but it lacked significant flavor. Same goes for my baklava ($1.50 for a TINY piece). My buddy got the shawarma, which lacked flavor. He had to order an extra dip to give it some taste to it.\\n\\nAll in all it wasn\\'t the worst experience, but we won\\'t be back.;I got a delicious chicken shawarma from this restaurant. I would love to come again. Also, I received a special respect from the staff.;Great food ! Authentic# good service but if you in the evening only one person, so there will be a line;I love to get my veggie fix on their very large platter of falafel roasted veggies. It is a favorful meal in a casual atmosphere.;This place is the best place to try the middle eastern or the arabic food, Shawarma, Falafel, Kabob so great.\\nThey really deserve 7 stars. They are really professional.\\nVery friendly, and nice team.\\nI love to go there and hope the best for them.;Well seasoned meats with good grill flavor. Best freakin\\' fries on H St NE.;Decent quick schwarma. Nice people.;Hey guys if you want to enjoy a good taste food this is the place for you;Great service and the food is tasty;Good food and service;The owner and chef are the best!\"'"
