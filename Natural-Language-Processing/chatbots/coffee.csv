What is the best temperature to brew coffee?,"According to chemical studies, the optimal water temperature for drip coffee is 95-98C. According to my notes, colder water doesn't extract enough caffeine/essential oils from the beans, and above such temperature the acidity increases wildly."
Quality of coffee,"The quality of a brew depends on the following factors (in no particular order):
Time since grinding the beans.
Time since roasting.
Cleanliness with brewing equipment.
Bean quality (what crop, etc.).
Water quality.

Effects of too much coffee,"Coffee is addictive Caffeine is a mildly addictive substance and people who stop its consumption experience some withdrawal effects. Coffee withdrawal can result in serious headaches that can last up to a week.
Coffee Abuse is dangerous Too much caffeine can produce restlessness, nausea, headache, tense muscles and sleep problems.
Coffee may aggravate ulcer problems and cause heartburns.
Sleep Problems Coffee and Skin Problems Caffeine and Calcium Absorption Coffee and Drugs Caffeinism"
Varieties of Coffee ,"The coffee type and roast are extremely important for the final product in our cups.
The most common types of coffee are arabica and robusta.
Arabica is the most commonly used type of coffee with more than 80% of the total coffee production.
Robusta is the second most used coffee variety and it is well known for its resistance to pests and cheaper production price.
Other less popular varieties of coffee include coffee Liberica, Cameroonian coffee, Congo coffee, Sierra Leonean coffee, and Bengal coffee.

What do you mean by coffee roast?,Coffee roasting is one of the most important steps in coffee production. The roasting is changing the chemical properties of the beans so they have the proper taste and aroma. Without roasting the coffee is bland without any flavor and taste. Various degrees of roasting permit the obtaining of different tastes and flavors. Some people prefer to buy green coffee and roast it at home for a better control of the taste and maximum freshness. The green beans are more stable than the roasted ones so the coffee won’t lose aroma.
What are the different roast degrees ,"Light roast: – Cinnamon Roast, New England Roast
Medium roast: – American Roast, City Roast, Full City Roast
Full roast: – Vienna Roast
Double roast: – French Roast, Italian Roast, Spanish or Turkish Roast, (Italian roast is my current favorite), and Spanish roast, is the darkest coffee roast possible.

How much caffeine is in a cup of coffee?,"Caffeine content in different types of coffee can vary. A standard cup of coffee (around 8oz) will contain an average of 94.8mg of caffeine. An Espresso on the other hand will have an average of 63mg of caffeine, and a standard latte will contain an average of 77mg of caffeine. The caffeine content depends on the size, strength and type of coffee you are consuming. "
How many calories are in a cup of coffee?,"Depending on the type of coffee you are drinking, the amount of calories will differ significantly. Adding extras such as milk, sugar and syrup will all directly affect the calorie content of a coffee. A standard cup of black coffee (around 8oz) contains 1 calorie, but a cappuccino for example can contain anywhere from 60 to 160 calories, depending on the type of milk you take and the size of the cappuccino."
What is fair trade coffee?,"Fair trade coffee is coffee that has been produced by a cooperative of farmers, importers, exporters and distributors that follow the standards set out by the FairTrade organisation. The FairTrade stamp on coffee is a certificate that guarantees the cooperative involved in the production of the coffee adhered to it’s standards, which include: set wages for farmers; environmentally sustainable practices; safe working conditions; exclusion of child labour; and agro-ecological practices, including reducing the use of chemical fertiliser and protecting forests."
Is coffee bad for you?,"Overall, coffee can have a lot of positive effects on the body. It’s health benefits include reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, improving the resting metabolic rate, and can even reduce the risk of certain types of cancers. Coffee can help ward off cognitive decline and boost long-term memory, and even reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. As well as these physical effects, coffee contains a large amount of nutrients and antioxidants such as vitamins B2, B3 and B5. The negatives of coffee are considerably smaller – becoming addicted to coffee and suffering withdrawal symptoms such as headaches is one example. The positives largely outweigh the negatives, but if you are drinking a large amount of coffee it could lead to disrupting your sleep due to a large caffeine intake."
Can you drink coffee while pregnant?,"You can drink coffee while you are pregnant, although it is recommended to limit the amount of caffeine you consume to around 200mg – which is about the equivalent of two mugs of coffee. Drinking more than this while pregnant could increase the risk of miscarriage, or having a baby with a low birth weight. Ultimately, the decision to consume caffeine is up to you, but you can cut down by switching to decaffeinated drinks and having smaller cups of coffee."
How long does caffeine last in coffee?,"Caffeine has a half-life of between 4-6 hours. This means that after the first half hour that is takes for coffee to kick in, the amount of caffeine in your system will cut in half after about 5 hours. This is why people often feel the need for a second cup of coffee during the day, as the caffeine amount has dropped significantly over the past few hours. If you are a smoker, the half-life of coffee is only 3 hours."
Where does coffee come from?,"Coffee is made from coffee beans, which are grown along the ‘Bean Belt’. This includes countries such as Brazil, Columbia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico. Coffee beans are harvested from the coffee tree as cherries, before going through a wet or dry process to ensure the beans are the correct moisture. The beans are then milled before being exported to their destination. From there, beans are roasted, and are sold whole or are ground down to fine or coarse grinds to be sold in shops."
How is coffee decaffeinated?,"Coffee can be decaffeinated through a few different processes. When decaffeinated, there will still be trace amounts of caffeine – generally, it contains around 0.1-0.3% caffeine. All decaffeinating processes take place while the coffee bean is green (unroasted). There are solvent-based processes – the indirect solvent process and the direct solvent process – and non-solvent based processes – the Swiss water process and carbon dioxide process. The solvent-based processes involve the caffeine being removed from the beans with the help of chemical solvents. The Swiss water method relies on osmosis and solubility to remove caffeine from beans by soaking the beans in hot water, and the carbon dioxide process soaks the beans and forces liquid carbon dioxide into the beans to extract the caffeine."
What is the difference between filter and instant coffee?,"Filter coffee and instant coffee are available in all shops, but it can be confusing to tell the difference if you aren’t an expert coffee drinker. Instant coffee is coffee that has been pre-brewed and can be re-hydrated when hot water is added to it. It dissolves and is ready to drink instantly. It is the coffee that is more accessible and is probably the coffee in the break room at work. Filter coffee on the other hand is ground roasted beans which your pour boiling water on and then filter, leaving only fresh coffee- this is what French presses are made for."
Why did coffee become popular?,"Coffee is the most popular beverage in the world, but how did it become that? The coffee bean’s history stretches back centuries. Tracing its origins to Ethiopia and the Arabian Peninsula, coffee was as popular then as it is now. Coffee houses started to gain traction around the 17th century in Europe, and the Boston Tea Party famously made the change from tea to coffee in 1773, leading to a boom of coffee popularity in America. Soldiers soon became addicted to coffee during WW2, as they used coffee to keep their energy levels high, and the invention of the television soon afterwards became a platform for instant coffee to be advertised. From here, a rise in modern coffee houses appeared, before coffee giant Starbucks materialised. From there, coffee has continued to become the most popular drink across the globe."
What coffee has the most caffeine?,"The caffeine content of a coffee is dictated by a few factors. First of all, the type of coffee bean used will affect its caffeine levels. Robusto coffee beans have the highest caffeine levels, whereas Arabica coffee beans contain half of this. A longer brewing time also means more caffeine – a French press for example is brewed for around 4 minutes so it will contain a decent amount of caffeine. An espresso on the other hand is only brewed for 20-30 seconds but because of it’s serving size, the caffeine content is more concentrated and therefore higher. Normal coffee has the highest content because of its brewing time (94mg), but espressos are a close second (63mg). Behind these are filter coffee, lattes and cappuccinos."
How to remove coffee stains,"Coffee stains can be dark and difficult to remove. As soon as coffee has been spilt, blot the stain with paper, and then rinse it with cold water. These two simple steps usually help to remove the stain, but if it is a little more stubborn, add detergent or vinegar to try and remove the stain. With detergent, rub it on, leave it for a few minutes and then rinse it off. With white vinegar and water, mix some detergent into a paste and add this to the stain, as long as you are sure it won’t cause any discolouration. Scrub the stain and rinse it thoroughly."
How many cups of coffee is it safe to drink a day?,"On average, the regular person is safe drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a day. Ultimately, its up to you to understand how your body responds to coffee, and to judge when you shouldn’t have any more. If you respond well to large amounts of caffeine, and don’t become jittery or get stomach pain, then you can drink what you want, but if you know that drinking lots of coffee keeps you up at night and leads to headaches in the morning, cut down to 3 cups a day. Drinking more than 5 cups of coffee a day has been linked to a raise in cholesterol, so if you’re a heavy coffee drinker sticking to 5 is the recommended amount."
What is espresso ?,"Espresso is not a kind of coffee bean. Espresso isn’t coffee concentrate. What it is is a manner of brewing coffee, and it’s also the name of the resulting beverage."
What’s cold brew and how is it different than iced coffee?,"hese terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but while cold brew is a kind of iced coffee, not all iced coffee is cold brew. In the overwhelming majority of coffee shops, there are really two main ways that cold coffee is produced – 1) by rapidly cooling the hot brewed coffee upon extraction (flash chilled), or 2) by removing the heating element and vastly extending the extraction time (cold brew). Flash chilled coffee is brewed directly on top of ice. This rapid cooling traps the good acids, prevents the bad acids and results in a clean and vibrant coffee. Cold brew involves steeping coffee without heat for an extended period of usually 12-24 hours."
"Does coffee ever go bad?
","For a variety of reasons it’s helpful to remember that coffee is an agricultural product (we’re drinking toasted fruit seeds after all). And though it doesn’t rot like an apple (due to the significant reduction in moisture level), it does stale. Once roasted, coffee beans continually release carbon dioxide, the bean fiber slowly decays and oxygen begins to age the coffee. Over time, the result is increased perceived bitterness, a notable dullness of flavor and diminished aroma. How quickly coffee stales is dependent upon a few factors – namely, the quality of the coffee and its roasting, how it was stored and whether the beans stay in whole form or are pre-ground. Pre-grinding coffee is absolutely the fastest way to stale it, as the increased surface area leads to more escaped carbon dioxide and greater exposure to oxygen. All that said, people will tell you coffee has a 2-3 week shelf life like it’s some magic number and everything tastes like garbage if it’s even a nanosecond older."
Does coffee make you go poop?,"It does for some people! There have been studies that found a “gastrocolonic response” in certain people soon after consuming coffee. The exact cause of this response isn’t fully understood, but scientists hypothesize that some of the chemicals in coffee may affect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Coffee also helps to release gastrin, a hormone that increases motor activity in the colon. It’s notable that research has identified this response in consumers of both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. "
Who produces the most coffee in the world?,"By far the largest coffee producer in the world is Brazil, with a whopping 5.7 billion lbs, followed by Vietnam (3.6 billion), Colombia (1.7 billion), Indonesia (1.4 billion) and Ethiopia (800 million). Keep in mind, though, that not all producing countries are growing “specialty grade” coffees, or even Arabica coffee, for that matter. You almost certainly won’t find coffee grown in Vietnam on specialty coffee shop shelves, as the nation’s focus is on large quantities of lower-quality Robusta coffee."
