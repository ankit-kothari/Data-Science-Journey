Business goal: Identify the $ amount and the number of customers that will be ideal to receive a coupoun code. 
1. Identify thee best customers (develop a ranking mechanism)
2. The budget is $1,000.
3. No indication was given about how much each coupon would be worth â€” it's for you to decide.
4. The coupons need to be good enough to prompt people to actually use them.
5. They can't be too high because:
     - That reduces the number of customers who get them.
     - It would be like giving away money.
     - Due to price dumping, it could be illegal.

6. Assumptions
     - a 30% discount is already very enticing;
     - weighted average of number of transactions and amount spend is good criteria to rank customers.
