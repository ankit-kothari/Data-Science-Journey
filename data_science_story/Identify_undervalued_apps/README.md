## **Business Goal**:
Develop a prototye to improve the revenue of undervalued apps to motivate the developers to keep working on them and give insigths on the feasability of the project

## **Constrains**
- No budget for marketing to increase revenue by Sales.

## **Data Quality**

- We found one erroneous data point which not only wasn't important, it was easy to fix. We should monitor this if management decides to move forward with the project to make sure it doesn't become an issue later on.
- We also found quite a few duplicates that were relatively easy to handle, but it would be better to deal with this from the start, lest it becomes a hard-to-manage problem.
    
## **Strategy**
- In order to limit the scope of this prototype, we included only four more features in our analysis: the ratings, the affordability, the categories, and the genres.
- We separated the data into price groups and broke those down according to category and genre to determine the candidates for price increases.

## **Results and Impact**

- Upon casting the votes and finding the majority, out of the 733 apps that were analyzed, 401 apps (roughly 55%) were deemed eligible for a price increase.
- To estimate the impact that increasing prices could have, we want to find the optimal price and have a sense of how many times each app will be purchased.
- It wasn't the goal of this prototype to determine the optimal price, so as a quick proxy, we used the average price for each app's affordability. As for the amount of times each app will be purchased, we don't have access to the data, so we tried to use the number of installations instead.
- In any case, given that roughly 60% of apps seem to be undervalued, our recommendation is that we move forward with this project. Here a few suggestions going forward.

## **Future Work**
-We fell short on evaluating the impact due to lack of data. A possible next step would be to request data concerning the number of purchases.
-Before we clean up our findings for communication, let's list some possible next steps for this project:
- Include unused data in the analysis, specifically:

1. The number of reviews;
2. The size of the app;
3. The content rating;
4. The last time the app was updated;
5. The app's Android versions;
